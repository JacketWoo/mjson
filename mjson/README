The format requirement:
1. key must be in a pair of quotes.
  for example: 
    {"age": 16}     OK
    {age: 16}       WRONG
2. value only support string, integer and jason
  for example:
    {"name": "wxf"}                     value is "wxf", string type
    {"age" : 20}                        value is 20, integer type, not within a pair of double quotes
    {"a" : {"b" : "c"}}                 value is json
    {"a" : [{"b":"c", "d":"e"}]}        value is json array
3. every element in the json must be represented by a kv. otherwise wrong
  for example:
    {"a":"b"}           OK
    {"a":"b", "c"}      WRONG 
4. every json array can only contains json, otherwise is wrong
  for example:
    [{"a":"b"},{"c":"c"}]        OK
    ["a":{"c":"d"}]              WRONG
